# Disgn-of-Information-Project
We are creating a online portal so that people can reserve items at the Blacksburg Farmers market.

This systems runs on flask and is hosted through the PythonAnywhere Website. 
The system is currently live at https://fmportal.pythonanywhere.com and can be viewed there.

To run this code as given you would have to set up a full python and flask enviroment on your computer and link it to a local host.
This is not how the system was designed to run however it was designed to work in the PythonAnywhere cloud enviroment that they provide. 

The main source code file is the flask_app.py this is where all of the decition making is done. All FlaskForms and database tables are generated in file as well.

The temblate folder contains all of the different HTML page views for each screen you can go to in the website.

The static folder contains static css files for styling the site. As well as all of the images that are generated when user upload pictures to our site for whatever reason they see fit.
